Method Overriding:


It is also called as Run time Polymorphism. This method is used to override a method in the super class with an implementation of same method in the Subclass.

@Override annotation is used to denote that a specific method is going to be overridden.


Sample program:

package selenium;

class America {
	void add() {

		System.out.println("This is America");
	}
}

public class Overriding extends America {

	@Override

	void add() {

		System.out.println("This is  Bangkok ");
	}

	public static void main(String[] Args) {

		Overriding object = new Overriding();

		object.add();

	}
}
